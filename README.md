Download the eq2cooldowntracker.zip file.
Unzip the folder (named eq2cooldowntracker) and place it inside your main scripts directory, so it should look like:
scripts/eq2cooldowntracker/
Additionally, place the EQ2CooldownTracker.iss file directly in the scripts directory (outside of the folder), like this:
scripts/EQ2CooldownTracker.iss

This way, both the folder and the .iss file are in the correct locations within your scripts folder.
